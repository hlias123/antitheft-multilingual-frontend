## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- All sensitive data is encrypted at rest
- PIN codes are hashed with salt
- Location data is encrypted before storage
- Photos include tamper-proof metadata

### Privacy
- No data collection without user consent
- Location data stays on device unless alarm is triggered
- Photos are only captured during security events
- User can delete all data at any time

### Anti-Tampering
- Root/jailbreak detection
- App signature verification
- Screenshot prevention
- Debug detection

## 📊 Performance

### Battery Optimization
- Intelligent GPS usage
- Background task optimization
- Low-power mode support
- Efficient data compression

### Storage Management
- Automatic cleanup of old data
- Photo compression
- Database optimization
- Cache management

## 🌐 Deployment

```bash
# Build release APK
cd android && ./gradlew assembleRelease

# Build AAB for Play Store
cd android && ./gradlew bundleRelease
```
